Can brainwaves be used to classify mental workload using machine learning algorithms?

The Jupyter Notebook files provided explore :
      -channel selection (exclusively on frontal lobe channels) or all channels
      -Support Vector Machine(SVM), K nearest neighbors (kNN),Decision Trees(DT), random forest(RF) and        logistic regression 
      -RobustScaler, StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler

The data used for classification was extended from an existing study found here: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/stew-simultaneous-task-eeg-workload-dataset
